# 🪁 Modular Monolith Architecture Style

> In **Modular Monolith Architecture**, the application is divided into modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. However, the entire application is still deployed as a single unit.

## Key Features
1. **Modular Design**: The application is divided into modules, each responsible for a specific functionality.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces, improving maintainability.
3. **Single Deployment**: The entire application is still deployed as one unit.
4. **Shared Database**: Typically uses a single database, but modules can have their own schemas or tables.


## When to Use
1. **Medium to Large Projects**: Suitable for applications with growing complexity but not ready for microservices.
2. **Better Maintainability**: Ideal for teams wanting a more organized and maintainable codebase than a traditional monolith.
3. **Future-Proofing**: A stepping stone toward microservices, allowing teams to prepare for future scalability.
4. **Single Team or Small Teams**: Works well for teams that want modularity without the overhead of distributed systems.


## Challenges
- Still a single deployment unit, so scaling is limited.
- Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling between modules.
- Not as scalable or fault-tolerant as microservices.
