# 🪁 Monolith Architecture Style

> In **Monolith Architecture**, the entire application is built as a single, tightly coupled unit. All components (e.g., Api, business logic, and data access) are part of the same codebase and deployed together.

## Key Features
1. **Single Codebase**: All components (UI, business logic, data access) are part of one project.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Components are highly dependent on each other, making changes riskier.
3. **Simple Deployment**: The entire application is deployed as a single unit.
4. **Centralized Database**: Typically uses a single database for all data storage and access.


## When to Use
1. **Small to Medium Projects**: Ideal for applications with limited complexity and scope.
2. **Rapid Development**: Suitable for projects requiring quick development and deployment.
3. **Small Teams**: Works well for small teams with limited resources.
4. **Low Scalability Needs**: Best for applications with predictable and low traffic.


## Challenges
- Harder to maintain as the codebase grows.
- Limited scalability (scaling requires scaling the entire application).
- Difficult to adopt new technologies incrementally.
