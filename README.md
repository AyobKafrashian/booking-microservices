## Architectural Styles and How to Choose the Right One

The repository is organized into `three folders`, each representing a different `architectural style`. Below is an overview of each style, along with guidance on when to choose it based on your `project requirements`, `team size`, `scalability needs`, and `long-term maintenance` goals.

### 1. Monolithic Architecture Style
> A traditional **monolithic architecture** where all components of the application are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/monolith.png" />
</div>

- **When to Choose**:
  - Your project is small or medium-sized.
  - You have a small development team.
  - You need to develop and deploy the application quickly.
  - The application has relatively simple functionality.
  - You don‚Äôt anticipate significant scaling needs in the near future.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple to develop, test, and deploy.
  - Easier to manage for small teams.
  - Lower operational overhead.
- **Cons**:
  - Tight coupling makes it harder to maintain as the codebase grows.
  - Scaling is limited to scaling the entire application.
  - Difficult to adopt new technologies or frameworks incrementally.

### 2. Modular Monolith Architecture Style
> A **modular monolith architecture** where the application is divided into modules, but still deployed as a single unit. This approach promotes better separation of concerns and maintainability.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/modular-monolith.png" />
</div>

- **When to Choose**:
  - Your project is medium to large-sized.
  - You want better separation of concerns and maintainability than a traditional monolith.
  - You plan to scale the application in the future but want to avoid the complexity of microservices.
  - Your team is growing, and you need a more organized codebase.
- **Pros**:
  - Better separation of concerns compared to a traditional monolith.
  - Easier to maintain and extend as the application grows.
  - Can be a stepping stone toward a microservices architecture.
  - Simpler deployment than microservices.
- **Cons**:
  - Still a single deployment unit, so scaling is limited.
  - Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling between modules.

### 3. Microservices Architecture Style
> A **microservices architecture** where the application is broken down into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/microservices.png" />
</div>

- **When to Choose**:
  - Your project is large and complex.
  - You need to scale different parts of the application independently.
  - Your team is large and can handle the complexity of distributed systems.
  - You need to adopt different technologies or frameworks for different parts of the application.
  - You require high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Pros**:
  - Independent development, deployment, and scaling of services.
  - Better fault isolation.
  - Flexibility to use different technologies for different services.
  - Easier to maintain and update individual services.
- **Cons**:
  - Higher complexity in development, testing, and deployment.
  - Requires robust DevOps practices and infrastructure.
  - Increased operational overhead (e.g., monitoring, logging, service discovery).


## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

- `Identity Service`: The Identity Service is a bounded context for the authentication and authorization of users using [Identity Server](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer). This service is responsible for creating new users and their corresponding roles and permissions using [.Net Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) and Jwt authentication and authorization.

- `Flight Service`: The Flight Service is a bounded context `CRUD` service to handle flight related operations.

- `Passenger Service`: The Passenger Service is a bounded context for managing passenger information, tracking activities and subscribing to get notification for out of stock products.

- `Booking Service`: The Booking Service is a bounded context for managing all operation related to booking ticket.


## Structure of Project

In this project I used a mix of [clean architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/), [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) and I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) to structure my files.

I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many "layers" in an application. We are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. We `minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/vertical-slice-architecture.png" />
</div>

Instead of grouping related action methods in one controller, as found in traditional ASP.net controllers, I used the [REPR pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern). Each action gets its own small endpoint, consisting of a route, the action, and an `IMediator` instance (see [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)). The request is passed to the `IMediator` instance, routed through a [`Mediatr pipeline`](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) where custom [middleware](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR/wiki/Behaviors) can log, validate and intercept requests. The request is then handled by a request specific `IRequestHandler` which performs business logic before returning the result.

The use of the [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) in my controllers creates clean and [thin controllers](https://codeopinion.com/thin-controllers-cqrs-mediatr/). By separating action logic into individual handlers we support the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), this is because traditional controllers tend to become bloated with large action methods and several injected `Services` only being used by a few methods.

I used CQRS to decompose my features into small parts that makes our application:

- Maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- Easy to maintain and add features to. Changes only affect one command or query, avoiding breaking changes or creating side effects.
- It gives us better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concern (with help of mediatr behavior pipelines), instead of bloated service classes doing many things.

Using the CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into vertical slices, for each of these slices we group classes (see [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders)) specific to that feature together (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, etc). In our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.
